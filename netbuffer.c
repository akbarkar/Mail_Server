 *  this size at least as big as the maximum line size for the
 *  protocol handled in this socket.
 *  
 *  Parameters: fd: Socket file descriptor.
 *              max_buffer_size: Maximum number of bytes to be stored
 *                               locally for a connection.

 *  Returns: A net_buffer_t object that can be used in other functions
 *           to read buffered data.

/** Reads a single line from the socket/buffer. If the socket returns
 *  more than one line in a single call to recv, returns a single line
 *  and caches the remaining data for the next call. The returned
 *  string will also include a null byte, which allows the out buffer
 *  to the handled as a regular string.
 *
 *  If a line with more than max_buffer_size bytes is read, then
 *  return the first max_buffer_size bytes (with a terminating null
 *  byte). It is the responsibility of the caller to check if the last
 *  character in the string is a line-feed (\n) character.
 *
 *  This function does not check for null bytes found in the middle of
 *  the string.
 *
 *  Parameter: nb: buffer object where socket and cache data are stored.
 *             out: array of bytes where the read line will be
 *                  stored. It must have space for at least
 *                  max_buffer_size bytes (from nb_create function)
 *                  plus one (for terminating null byte).
 *
 *  Returns: If the connection was terminated properly, returns 0. If
 *           the connection was terminated abruptly or another unknown
 *           error is found, returns -1. Otherwise, returns the number
 *           of bytes in the read line.
